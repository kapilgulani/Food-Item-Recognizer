# Food Item Recognizer

## Project Overview

The **Food Item Recognizer** is a machine learning project aimed at accurately identifying food items from images and estimating their calorie content. This application can help users track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

## Project Details

- **Dataset**: The model uses the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101), which consists of 101 different food categories, each with 1,000 images.
- **Model Architecture**: The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with InceptionV3 as the base model, which is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. Additional layers were added to fine-tune the model for food classification.
- **Training**: Due to resource constraints, the model has not been fully trained within this notebook. The code includes all necessary steps to preprocess data, build the model, and initiate training.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Food-Item-Recognizer.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Food-Item-Recognizer
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Food-Item-Recognizer.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

- **Training the Model**: Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the model, and train it. If you have a GPU-enabled environment, training can be completed more quickly.
- **Predicting with the Model**: After training, you can use the trained model to predict food items from new images.
